As a team, we developed Fitzone, a responsive gym website using HTML, pure CSS, and TailwindCSS. This project provides essential information about our gym and encourages users to become part of our fitness community. The website includes four key sections:

📖 About Us: Introduces the gym, outlining our mission, values, and the community we aim to build.
📝 Join Us: A simple membership sign-up page that makes it easy for users to join the gym.
📍 Location: Provides details about the gym's location, including a map and parking info.
🏋️ Equipment: Showcases the gym's wide range of equipment with descriptions and images.
Check out the project live at fitzone-final.vercel.app or explore the code on GitHub.

Through this collaborative project, we improved our front-end development skills and created a clean, responsive design that enhances the user experience and strictly for desktop screens.
